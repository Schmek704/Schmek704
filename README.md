- 👋 Hi, I’m @Schmek704
- 👀 I’m interested in all things coding, with a professional focus on data science and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on certifications in Python and data science, with a general focus towards adding to my professional profile of systems management and analysis with my current job. I have completed several IBM based Professional Certification courses, including Data Analytics and data Science, as well as developing a Full Stack Cloud certification. 
- 💞️ I’m looking for any assistance and direction in data science and machine learning. Hoping to find a good mentor to bounce ideas off of and keep me focused on the goals at hand.
- 📫 You can message me directly on GitHub if you have any relevant direction to follow or new certifications that are relevant to the goals.
