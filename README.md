Hello! I'm Schmek704!  I am a Software Manager, SysAdmin, and Operations/Data Analyst for a NC Restaurant company.  Been with the company for 19 years. Currently studying Data Science in my spare time and mastering SQL and Python. I am also proficient in JavaScript, HTML, Tableau, Cognos, and Excel.  I am curious and pasionate about solving riddles, learning new things, and playing with my pups. If you're in the data science field and would like to connect, please message me through GitHub and we can exchange contact info. Would like to use gitHub social as a way to extend my network of data contacts!
