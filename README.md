- 👋 Hi, I’m @Schmek704
- 👀 I’m interested in all things coding, with a professional focus on data science and machine learning. On a personal level, I am creating a simple game with my daughter that she can share with her sisters and friends to help her on her journey of becoming an engineer in later life!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on certifications in Python and data science, with a general focus towards adding to my current professional profile of systems management and analysis with my current job. I will be posting projects and ideas to gist and GitHub over the next year.
- 💞️ I’m looking for any assistance and direction in data science and machine learning. Hoping to find a good mentor to bounce ideas off of and keep me focused on the goals at hand.
- 📫 You can message me directly on GitHub if you have any relevant direction to follow or new certifications that are relevant to the goals.
